# Question

Identify the problems with this macro definition:
    
    #define ISDIGIT(c) ((c >= '0') && (c <= '9')) ? 1 : 0
    
# Solution

First off, it needs parentheses around the whole macro so `(((c > = '0' ... : 0)`
and second, this could result in multiple execution of the c parameter, 
resulting in undefined behavior.
