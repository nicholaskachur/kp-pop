# Question

Comment on the choice of names and values in the following code.

    #define TRUE 0
    #define FALSE 1

    if ((ch = getchar()) == EOF)
        not_eof = FALSE;

# Solution

First, the `#define`s are inaccurate, in C (and most other languages) 0 is
false and 1 is true, thus the first two lines are flipped. Second, `not_eof`
is a little confusing. This is more of a nitpick, but it would be easier to
read, and less susceptible to double negatives if it were just positive `eof`.
Third, `not_eof = FALSE` produces the wrong value, the if statement it belongs
to is triggered if there _is_ EOF, but this makes `not_eof` equal to `1`, which
means true, so this whole thing is buggered.
