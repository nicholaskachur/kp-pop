# Question

List all the different outputs this could produce with various orders of
evaluation:

    n = 1;
    printf("%d %d\n", n++, n++);

# Solution

The "correct" result is "1 2", but it could also produce "2 1", as was 
evidenced when I ran on two different machines. A MacBook Pro compiling with
LLVM Clang 7.0.0 produced "1 2", while a Linux server running GCC produced
"2 1".
