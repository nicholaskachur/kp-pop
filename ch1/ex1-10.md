# Question

How would you rewrite these definitions to minimize potential errors?

    #define FT2METER 0.3048
    #define METER2FT 3.28084
    #define MI2FT 5280.0
    #define MI2KM 1.609344
    #define SQMI2SQKM 2.589988

# Solution

One way to do this would be to use an enum type in C, or another would be to
make them all global constants in C++ or Java.
