# Question

What is wrong with this excerpt?

    int read(int *ip) {
        scanf("%d", ip);
        return *ip;
    }
        ...
    insert(&graph[vert], read(&val), read(&ch));

# Solution

This one I'm not so sure about. The `read` function invokes scanf, so it's
not safe to use it as a parameter to another function...?
