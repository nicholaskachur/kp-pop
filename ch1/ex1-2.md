# Question

Improve this function:

    int smaller(char *s, char *t) {
        if (strcmp(s, t) < 1)
            return 1;
        else
            return 0;
    }

# Solution

This is a really small bug, so I'm not sure if this is it, but the if statement
should be `if (strcmp(s, t) < 0)` to make it actually smaller, not "smaller
or equal to".

Other than that, I don't see any real issues with the parameter names, x and y
would've been just as descriptive.

    int smaller(char *s, char *t) {
        if (strcmp(s, t) < 0) // Change to '< 0' to make this actually test
                              // whether or not s is smaller than t
            return 1;
        else
            return 0;
    }
