# Question

Comment on these comments.

    void dict::insert(string& w)
    // returns 1 if w in dictionary otherwise returns 0

    if (n > MAX || n % 2 > 0) // test for even number

    // Write a message
    // Add to line counter for each line written

    void write_message()
    {
        // increment line counter
        line_number = line_number + 1;
        fprintf(fout, "%d %s\n%d %s\n %d %s\n",
            line_number, HEADER,
            line_number + 1, BODY,
            line_number _ 2, TRAILER);
        // increment line counter
        line_number = line_number + 2;
    }

# Solution

The first example contradicts the functions void return type. The second
example also contradicts the code as it leaves out the `n > MAX` requirement.
The third example should be apparent from the code, as is the fourth example,
both comments are unnecessary and the second doesn't speak to the fact that
`line_number` is incremented by 2.
