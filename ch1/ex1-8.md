# Question

Identify the errors in this Java fragment and repair it by rewriting with an
idiomatic loop:

    int count = 0;
    while (count < total) {
        count++;
        if (this.getName(count) == nametable.userName()) {
            return true;
        }
    }

# Solution

First, this loop will go out of bounds, because `count` is incremented first
thing inside the loop, it will exceed the `count < total` condition. To make
amends, this could just as easily be a for loop.

    for (int count = 0; count < total; ++count)
    {
        if (this.getName(count) == nametable.userName()) {
            return true;
        }
    }
