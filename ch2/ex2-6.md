# Question

Implement the necessary changes to `addname` and `delname` to delete items by
marking them as unused. How isolated is the rest of the program from this change?

# Solution

The changes to `addname` and `delname` are relatively minor. In `addname`,
intead of simply adding the new name to the `nval` position, it must simply
loop over the `nvtab.nameval` array until it comes to an empty position and
then place it there. In `delname`, instead of calling `memmove`, simply set the
`nvtab.nameval` at the correct position to `NULL`, and call it a day.

See `ex2-6.c` for an example implementation of this.
