# Question

Implement the necessary changes to `addname` and `delname` to delete items by
marking them as unused. How isolated is the rest of the program from this change?

# Solution

The changes to `addname` and `delname` are relatively minor. In `addname`,
intead of simply adding the new name to the `nval` position, it must simply
loop over the `nvtab.nameval` array until it comes to an empty position and
then place it there. In `delname`, instead of calling `memmove`, simply set the
`nvtab.nameval` at the correct position so that its name field is `NULL`, and
call it a day.

See `ex2-6.c` for an example implementation of this. In my implementation, I had
a lot of trouble with Segmentation Faults and improper access of memory (whether
NULL or not), so I had to go through the trouble of actively making the `name`
of each `nameval` element `NULL` to mark them as empty. This extra step reduces
performance a little, but I couldn't think of any other way to guarantee a safe
base state of the memory without using `calloc` instead of `realloc` which would
be even less ideal.
