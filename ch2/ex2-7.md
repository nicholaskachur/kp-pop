# Question

Implement some of the other list operators: copy, merge, split, insert before
or after a specific item. How do the two insertion operations differ in
difficulty? How much can you use the routines we've written, and how much must
you create yourself?

# Solution

See `ex2-7.c` for these implementations, most of which are relatively similar
to the already developed routines, but which require enough tweaking that I felt
it more efficient to write them independently of each other.
