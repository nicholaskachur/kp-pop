# Question

Our Jaca quicksort does a fair amount of type conversion as items are cast from
their original type (like `Integer`) to `Object` and back again. Experiment with
a version of `Quicksort.sort` that uses the specific type being sorted to 
estimate what perfromance penalty is incurred by type conversions.

# Solution

See ex2-2.java
