# Question

Our Jaca quicksort does a fair amount of type conversion as items are cast from
their original type (like `Integer`) to `Object` and back again. Experiment with
a version of `Quicksort.sort` that uses the specific type being sorted to 
estimate what perfromance penalty is incurred by type conversions.

# Solution

Both generic and specific quicksort are implemented in `Ex2_2.java`. In my tests
I ran 100 sorts on 10,000 element arrays of type `Integer` and `String`.
Directly using the types instead of through `Object` didn't seem to have much
effect on the performance either way.

_Ugh, here comes the Java..._
