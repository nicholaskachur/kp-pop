# Question

In the code above `delname` doesn't call `realloc` to return the memory freed
by the deletion. Is this worthwhile? How would you decide whether to do so?

# Solution

Calling `realloc` would let the OS know that the memory is no longer in use,
but we very well may call `addname` in the future, so it is not necessarily
a good idea to even free the memry in the first place. Freeing the memory would
shrink the `Nameval` array, when it may not be what we want to do. If you do
intend to shrink the array, or are working with limited memory, than it may be
a good idea to call `realloc`, but otherwise, it is probably just better to
leave the array as it is.
