# Question

Design and implement an algorithm that will sort an array of _n_ integers as
slowly as possible. You have to play fair: the algorithm must make progress
and eventually terminate, and the implementation must not cheat with tricks
like time-wasting loops. What is the complexity of your algorithm as a function
of _n_?

# Solution

My implementation of `nicksort` uses two pointers into the array to be sorted,
`left` and `right`. It checks if item pointed to by `right` is less than that
pointed to by `left`, and if so swaps them. Then it increments `right` and
repeats the process until `right` points to the end of the array, then it
increments `left` and repeats the whole process until `left` points to the end
of the array (or rather, one less than the end).

In this way, it always performs n! compares and a maximal number of swaps. In
the best case (sorted and homogeneous arrays), it performs no swaps, but still
has n! compares, and in the worst case scenario (reverse sorted arrays), it
also performs n! swaps. In general, average case performance is O(n!).

`ex2-4.c` implements both quicksort and nicksort and compares them. Run it
with the number of elements you want in each array and the number of runs you
want it to make. On testing with 1,000 and 10,000 random elements per array,
Nicksort was almost two orders of magnitude slower than quicksort, proving
that this is definitely a non-ideal algorithm.
