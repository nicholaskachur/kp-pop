# Question

Quicksort is most naturally expressed recursively. Write it iteratively and
compare the two versions. (Hoare describes how hard it was to work out quicksort
iteratively, and how neatly it fell into place when he did it recursively.)

# Solution

`ex2-1.c` implements both quicksorts and provides a test harness for running
a given number of tests on arrays with a given number of elements.

In my runs, on 10000 elements per arry, iterative quicksort is almost two
orders of magnitude faster than recursive quicksort. This doesn't seem
right, but after spending almost three hours on and off tinkering with
the iterative algorithm, I'm not sure what could be wrong. Both sorts work on
small test arrays, and there is no reason to belive they are functioning 
incorrectly on the larger sizes. Whatever the case may be, iterative was
definitely harder to write and comprehend, but may be faster in the end.
