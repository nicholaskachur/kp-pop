# Question

What are some input sequences that might cause a quicksort implementation to
display worst-case behavior? Try to find some that provoke your library version
into running slowly. Automate the process so that you can specify and perform a
large number of experiments easily.

# Solution

First off, to maximize the time taken in quicksort we must maximize the number
of recursive calls and the number of swaps. To maximize the number of swaps,
we could have a reverse order sorted list (e.g. 9, 8, 7, ... 3, 2, 1).
Quicksort is also vulnerable if all the elements of the list are the same,
the `last` counter won't be incremented, so it will have to travel down the
entire list before returning. Depending on the partitioning scheme, it might
also break down when the list is already sorted.

Unfortunately, my attempts to provoke worst case behavior in C's Standard
Library function `qsort` were for nought (`ex2-3.c`). Sorted, reverse order,
and homogenoeous arrays were all sorted faster than purely random arrays, so
it would seem that the Standard Library implementers know their stuff and
have implemented safeguards against worst-case performance. Either that, or
the swaps are really the critical path of `qsort`.
