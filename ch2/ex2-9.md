# Question

Write a generic `List` type in C. The easiest way is to have each list item hold
a `void*` that points to the data. Do the same for C++ by defining a template
and for Java by defining a class that holds lists of type `Object`. What are the
strengths and weaknesses of the various languages for this job?

# Solution

See `ex2-9.c`, `ex2-9.cpp`, and `Ex2_9.java`.
